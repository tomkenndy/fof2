The Transactions file can only send eth from an account to another account.
I would like it to allow depositing eth from an address to the contract.
I have tried many ways but Im getting an error during transaction, something to do with :
'Warning! Error encountered during contract execution [out of gas] '
'Warning! Error encountered during contract execution [execution reverted]'
